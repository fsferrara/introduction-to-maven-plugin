This is a toy project in which I want to experiment with iOS views lifecycle.

The sample app consists of a main view with a set of buttons.
Each button, when tapped, presents a different type of view (e.g., modal view, navigation view, tab view, etc.).

The goal is to observe and log the lifecycle events of each view type, both SwiftUI and UIKit, to understand how they behave in different scenarios.
