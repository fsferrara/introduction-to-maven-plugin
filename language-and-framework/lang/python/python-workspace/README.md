# Python - Data science workspace

## Prerequisites

You can use a [custom python configuration](./PlainPython.md), but you'll deal with a lot of packages.
If you're bored of installing all these packages for data science purpose, then evaluate to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), the world's most popular Python/R data science platform.


## Plotting with matplolib

In the data science domain, it is common to plot data. Matplot is used in this case:
`python3 -m pip install matplotlib`

If using Linux, then you need to install `python3-tk` as well:
`sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
*tk* stands for _Tkinter_ and is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package.
